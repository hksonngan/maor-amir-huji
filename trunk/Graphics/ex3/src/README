Answer (phong shader question):
--------------------------------
The most significant difference we see when switching between the phong
and the blinn models is that in the blinn model the specular highlights
appear to be bigger and "spread" over larger area then in the phong 
model. The reason for that is that according to the model, the angle between
the viewer (V) and the reflected beam (R) is larger then the angle between the 
normal (N) and the half-verctor(H) (at most cases the first is twice the second). 
Therefore the cosine of the second angle(the blinn angle) is larger. 
Because the cosine of the angles equals to the dot products that is used in the models, 
the dot product of N and H (which is used in the blinn model) is greater 
then the dot product between V and R (which is used in the phong model). 
This causes the specular calculation in the blinn model to get greater values, 
and therefore causes the highlights to appear bigger in the blinn model.

Remarks
-------
* We had an extension of 1 day.
